# Python_beginner_projects

     I created this repository to improve my python skills by creating a few beginner projects. 
     I completed these projects from Kylie Ying's YouTube series on FreeCodeCamp.
     Hope this will be helpful for others starting their python journey ;)

#### 1. `madlibs` : Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game which consists of one player prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story.
        `madlibs.py` shows you different ways in which you can input strings for practise.
        `sample_madlibs` has a bunch of madlibs and `random_madlibs.py` has the actual code for execution. Have fun! 
#### 2. `guess_number` : You can guess the number or make your computer guess the number
        `main.py` there are two functions: guess() and computer_guess()
