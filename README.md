# Python_beginner_projects

     I created this repository to improve my python skills by creating a few beginner projects. 
     I completed these projects from Kylie Ying's YouTube series on FreeCodeCamp.
     Hope this will be helpful for others starting their python journey ;)

1. `madlibs` : Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game which consists of one player prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story.
   - `madlibs.py` shows you different ways in which you can input strings for practise.
   - `sample_madlibs` has a bunch of madlibs and `random_madlibs.py` has the actual code for execution. Have fun! 
   
2. `guess_number` : You can guess the number or make your computer guess a number.
     - `main.py` there are two functions: guess() and computer_guess() which will do the trick!
     
3. `rock_paper_scissors` : Play rock, paper, scissors with the computer!
     - `rock_paper_scissors.py` has simple code to implement this game.
     
4. `hangman` : A word game where you test your vocabulary!
     - `hangman.py` has the code for execution of the game and `words.py` has a list of hundreds of words which is imported into the main code.
     
5. `tic-tac-toe` : Play with the random computer, play with the smart computer or make the random computer and smart computer play against each other!     
     - `player.py` has different types of players(human, random computer, smart computer) and `game.py` has the code for implementation of tic-tic-toe.
     - We are using Minimax Algorithm to create a Tic-Tac-Toe AI. Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal          move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally. It is widely used in two player turn-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Backgammon, Mancala, Chess, etc.
6. `binary_search` : `binary_search.py` implementing both naive search & binary search and comparing their implementation time.
     - Binary search follows divide and conquer approach. We leverage the fact that our list is SORTED.
